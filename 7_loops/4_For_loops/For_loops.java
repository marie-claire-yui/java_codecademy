// For Loops

// A for loop header is made up of the following three parts, each separated by a semicolon:

//     The initialization of the loop control variable.
//     A boolean expression.
//     An increment or decrement statement.

// In a for loop, an initialization statement is run once in order to initialize the loop control variable.
// This variable is modified in every iteration, can be referenced in the loop body, 
// and used to test the boolean condition. In the example above, i is the loop control variable.

// for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  
    // i = 0: i is initialized to 0
    // i < 5: the loop is given a boolean condition that relies on the value of i. The loop will continue to execute until i < 5 is false.
    // i++: i will increment at the end of each loop and before the condition is re-evaluated.

//   // code that will run
    //the code will run through the loop a total of five times.
// }

// iterate = means that we are repeating the same block of code.
