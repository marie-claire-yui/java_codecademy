// INTRODUCTION TO LOOPS

// A loop is a programming tool that allows developers to repeat the same block of code until some condition is met. 

// First, a starting condition is evaluated. If the starting condition is true, then the loop body is executed.
// When the last line of the loop body is executed, the condition is re-evaluated. 
//This process continues until the condition is false 
//(if the condition never becomes false, we can actually end up with an infinite loop!). 
//If the starting condition is false, the loop never gets executed.

// We employ loops to easily scale programs - saving time and minimizing mistakes.


    // while loops
    // for loops
    // for-each loops
