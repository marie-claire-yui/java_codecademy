// Introduction to conditional operators

// Java includes operators that only use boolean values. 
// These conditional operators help simplify expressions containing complex boolean relationships 
//by reducing multiple boolean values to a single value: true or false.

// if we want to run a code block only if multiple conditions are true. We could use the AND operator: &&.
// we want to run a code block if at least one of two conditions are true. We could use the OR operator: ||.
// we can produce the opposite value, where true becomes false and false becomes true, with the NOT operator: !.
// check truth table
