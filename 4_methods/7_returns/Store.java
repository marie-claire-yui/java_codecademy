// Remember, variables can only exist in the scope that they were declared in. 
// We can use a value outside of the method it was created in if we return it from the method. 
// The return valueâ€™s type must match the return type of the method. 
//If the return expression is compatible with the return type, a copy of that value gets returned in a process known as return by value.
  // We return a value by using the keyword return:
public double getPriceWithTax(){ // we replace void by double to signify that the return type is a double
  double totalPrice = price + price * 0.08;
  return totalPrice;
  // Once the return statement is executed, the compiler exits the function.
  // Any code that exists after the return statement in a function is ignored.

    // Within main method(), we called getPriceWithTax() method on lemonadePrice

// rq: We learned how to return primitive values from a method
// Returning an object works a little differently than returning a primitive value. When we return a primitive value, a copy of the value is returned; 
//however, when we return an object, we return a reference to the object instead of a copy of it.
