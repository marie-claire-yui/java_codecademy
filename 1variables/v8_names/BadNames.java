// Naming variables according to convention leads to clear, readable, and maintainable code. When someone else, or our future self, reads the code, there is no confusion about the purpose of a variable
// In Java, variable names are case-sensitive
// A variable starts with a valid letter, or a $, or a _. No other symbols or numbers can begin a variable name
// Variable names of only one word are spelled in all lowercase letters. Variable names of more than one word have the first letter lowercase while the beginning letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.
