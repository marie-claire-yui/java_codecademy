// To review, here are some of the main takeaways about static methods and variables:
//     Static methods and variables are associated with the class as a whole, not objects of the class.
//     Static methods and variables are declared as static by using the static keyword upon declaration.
//     Static methods cannot interact with non-static instance variables. This is due to static methods not having a this reference.
//     Both static methods and non-static methods can interact with static variables.
