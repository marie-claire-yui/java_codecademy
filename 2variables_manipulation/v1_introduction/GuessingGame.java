// we have the ability to manipulate the value of our variables.
// We can use expressions, arithmetic operators, and more in order to change our variablesâ€™ values. 
//The data type of a variable plays a large role in the operations we can use to manipulate it. 
// We can think of a data type as a combination of a set of values, and a set of operations on those values. 
// The data type of an expression is determined by the resulting value.
// For example, an expression that uses two int values will evaluate to an int value. 
// If an expression contains a double value, then the resulting value will also be type double.
