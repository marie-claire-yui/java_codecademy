// Java is an object-oriented programming language where every program has at least one class.
// Programs are often built from many classes and objects, which are the instances of a class. 
// Classes define the state and behavior of their instances.
// Behavior comes from methods defined in the class. 
// State comes from instance fields declared inside the class.
// Classes are modeled on the real-world things we want to represent in our program
// This program is a single class (we'll explore multiple classes program later)
